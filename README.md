# Project 3 API
# Application Title: Single Page Application for creating and attending Parties
This application allows the user to Party. More specifically, this SPA allows a user to view existing parties without having to sign up or sign in- making sure that everyone who wants to party, knows which parties are out there! Additionally, after signing in, a user can create a party, update a party, delete a party and view their RSVPs.
But why? why go through all the trouble to create a web app mainly for cataloging parties? Because parties are excellent. (please read this sentence in Garth voice)

## Planning Story
It was early on Tuesday Morning, when Caley, Simon Ryan and Nina came together to talk over the "hangout" prompt. As a group, the four broke down the different requirements and their associated features for both the back end and the front end.
Simon and Ryan paired off to Para-program the front end, specifically they html  and handlebars framework for each feature, as Caley and Nina tackled the API for GET, SHOW and DELETE Parties. Following a schedule that divided each day into two mini sprints with Stand-ups in the morning, before lunch and before end of day- MPV was reached by end of day Wednesday 1/8/2020. Thursday was use to focus on styling and functionality of myRSVP button, which would return the Parties the signed in user had RSVP'ed too.
